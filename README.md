# MalwareAnalysis (ApateDNS and FakeNet)
Activities:
1. Open a browser on the XP machine. Send a request for an image file from a
hypothetical (or real) HTTP server. What happens when you do this?
2. Send another request for a web page through HTTPS. What do you notice?
3. Try downloading an executable (either .com or .exe file) from any website. What
happens when you make this request?
4. Execute three differnt samples of malware and note/record their network behaviour as observed by you
and/or logged with the tools.
• Which domains are the samples trying to contact?
• What http requests (if any) are being made and when do these requests occur?
• From the logs, traffic capture and tool outputs, can you establish the sequence of
events in the malware samples’ network activities?
